My feet sit under my desk doing nothing all day, it was time to put them to use. I'm a big music fan and pretty much listen to much all day long. I usually pause/play/skip songs with my keyboard but if I were typing out a YouTube description and I wanted to skip a song, I would have to stop typing, hit the skip key, and THEN finish the description. What a waste of time. Not anymore!
